#### Here are the remaining things I need to do to finalise the project:

CODE

- Add the Weights and Biases logging and or prompts logging to track token usage. DONE
- Fix the debugging so human input actually works. 
- Generate pipeline visualisation which I can log to wandb. DONE???
- Tracking token usage???? - just write about it 
- Example pipelines
- README reflective of the project, add demo video(s)
-- remove additional user input issues
-- reformat the system prompts.
-- add ability to control temperature from pipeline (only if specified)
-- add ability to add model name to pipeline (only if specified), else use default gpt-4
- add a way for each module to automatically know what the original steps were. 
--- add it so the module knows the pipeline steps that have been taken so far.
-- add create pull request module with repositroy.

REPORT

- Add a cool gif at the beginning
- Discuss cost.
- Finish the article.
--- talk about the fact the modular system means easy to construct and maintain.
--- decomposable parts means less memory problems.
--- pipeline means you can start from an exisiting repository.
--- self building options.
